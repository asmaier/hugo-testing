A new silhouette introduced to the Gucci Horsebit 1955 line for Spring Summer 2020, the top handle has a domed shape with an optional leather shoulder strap, crafted from GG Supreme canvas and leather. The collection unifies details first introduced on the original bag that inspired the line from over six decades ago with a modern spirit, highlighting the Horsebit. Part of Gucciâ€™s genetic code, the double ring and bar design has been established as one of the most distinctive elements among the House symbols borrowed from the equestrian world.
