The Oyster Perpetual Datejust is the epitome of the classic Rolex watch. 

Created in 1945, the Datejust was the first self-winding waterproof chronometer wristwatch to display the date in a window at 3 o’clock on the dial – hence its name. With its timeless aesthetics, functions and rich history, the Datejust is a watchmaking icon and one of the brand’s most recognizable watches.
