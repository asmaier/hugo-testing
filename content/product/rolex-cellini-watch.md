The Cellini collection celebrates the eternal elegance of traditional timepieces with a contemporary touch; the name was inspired by the Italian Renaissance artist, Benvenuto Cellini.

This collection combines the best of Rolex know-how and its high standards of perfection with an approach that heightens watchmaking heritage in its most timeless form. The lines of the Cellini models are sober and refined, the materials noble, the finishings luxurious: every detail respects the codes of the art of watchmaking.
