This is a [page bundle], specifically a leaf bundle.  The structure is:



```text
content/posts/post-15/
├── a.jpg
└── index.md
```

With leaf bundles, we can keep the page assets (e.g., images, etc.) with the content file (i.e., the markdown file).

![A kitten](a.jpg "This is a kitten!")

The water ouzel, in his rocky home amid foaming waters, seldom sees a gun, and of all the singers I like him the best. He is a plainly dressed little bird, about the size of a robin, with short, crisp, but rather broad wings, and a tail of moderate length, slanted up, giving him, with his nodding, bobbing manners, a wrennish look.
