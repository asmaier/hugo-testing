Heritage Park is a City of Calgary-funded museum of sorts, featuring many buildings from Alberta’s past, restored and placed in a town-like setting. There’s a “farm” full of animals, a working steam train, antique amusement rides, a paddlewheeler that runs on the reservoir, and the staff reenact events that might have once happened. We went there a lot when the kids were younger – it’s the easiest place to take a kid and have fun with almost no plan – so I have a lot of pictures (`cough` of trains `cough`).
